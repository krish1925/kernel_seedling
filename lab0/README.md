# A Kernel Seedling
TODO: In this lab, we are creating a kernel module that creates a file /proc/count (the code for which is written in the file proc_count.c) and writing a program that writes the number of processes currently running on the system. For this we are using a Linux 5.14.8 kernel on a virtual machine, and importing/exporting files that we have to use and run on the machine using git. 

## Building
```shell
TODO: The command for building is make, which generates a list of files post compiling(running on the specifications of the Makefile) Then running the command sudo insmod proc_count.ko inserts the modules in the kernel(rm the modules after every run)
## Running
```shell
TODO: cmd for running binary
To run the binary(and insert it in kernel), we used sudo insmod proc_count.ko, which is one of the files generated by the make command used to build above. The .ko file is a kernel module that could dynamically be loaded and unloaded into the kernel. This command inserts the module into the kernel as the administrator. 

```
TODO: To check the number of processes, all we have to do is check the file /proc/count, which stores the number of processes running. This can be done with the command cat /proc/count
## Cleaning Up
```shell
TODO: cmd for cleaning the built binary
to clean the built binary, I used the command sudo rmmod proc_count. This removes the binary file inserted in the kernel with administrator permission.
```

## Testing
```python
python -m unittest
```
TODO: The results for the test came out to be "OK" which meant it passed the test cases", and I intentionally tested whether the test cases were working fine by initializing process_count to 1 instead of zero, and this showed that in each of the cases there was an extra process showing up in my output.

Report which kernel release version you tested your module on
(hint: use `uname`, check for options with `man uname`).
It should match release numbers as seen on https://www.kernel.org/.

```shell
uname -r -s -v
```
TODO: After running the above command via shell, the kernel version is : Linux 5.14.8-arch1-1 #1 SMP PREEMPT Sun, 26 Sept 2021 19:36:15 +0000.
